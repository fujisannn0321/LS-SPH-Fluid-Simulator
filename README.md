# LS-SPH-Fluid-Simulator

This is an open-source fluid simulation code based on the Least Squares Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (LS-SPH) [[1](#ref1)], a high-precision and generalized extension of classical SPH.

This code provides the following features (üì£ indicates new additions):
1. A variety of standard fluid benchmark problems, including:
   - 2D Taylor-Green vortex üì£
   - 2D Lid-driven cavity flow üì£
   - 2D Boussinesq convection üì£
2. Applications to geophysical and engineering problems (currently under development)

## üéØ Features

- Implementation of both LS-SPH and classical SPH models
- Support for 2D fluid simulations
- Written in Fortran with OpenMP and Python

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- [Intel Fortran compiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html#gs.n7d5f5) (using `ifx`)
- Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library) for linear algebra routines
- `make` utility for building Fortran files
- Python with common libraries (e.g., `matplotlib`, `scipy`)
- `ffmpeg` for movie generation

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

The following example shows how to simulate the 2D Taylor-Green vortex:

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to `sph_code/2d-fixed-wall/source_code/` .
3. Run `make` to build the program.
4. Run `./start_calculation` to start the simulation.
5. After the simulation finishes, run `TG_main.py` to generate figures.


> [!NOTE]
> To simulate other cases, please refer to the [User Manual (Japanese)](./manual.pdf) and set the appropriate parameters.
